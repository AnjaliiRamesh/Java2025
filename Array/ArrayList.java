//What is it??
// ArrayList is a resizable array.
// You can keep adding or removing items, and it adjusts the size for you behind the scenes.


//Use it when:
// You donâ€™t know how many elements you'll have
// You need to add/remove elements easily
// You want to store and access things in order

// Example
// Think of an array as a thali with 5 fixed bowls.
// You can't add an extra bowl after it's made.
// But ArrayList is like a buffet plate â€” you can keep adding items, no fixed size ðŸ˜„
